# sxmo-dev

Sxmo is a collection of simple / suckless X programs and scripts that are designed 
to work together to provide an simple and hackable mobile enviroment. Currently sxmo 
targets the [Pinephone]().

At the moment development is more focused on how can we provide a workable mobile 
hackable linux mobile-friendly desktop enviroment then how can we enable calls / 
texting. GPS is included out of the box however.

Included in sxmo are the following programs:

- [dwm](): The infamous suckless window manager, heart of sxmo. Patched so that the Pinephone's 3 hardware buttons can be used to execute different functions depending on how long each is pressed for.
- [sxkbd](): The suckless onscreen keyboard with a custom commandline-oriented / mobile-optimized layout.
- [dmenu](): Used for menu selection, patched so it is usable with just the Pinephone's 3 hardware buttons. Also patched for visual apperance etc.
- [surf](): The primary browser for sxmo, patched in various ways, intresting with [externalpipe]() allows non-touch based link following.
- [st](): The terminal emulator
- [foxtrotgps](): A relativly simple GPS program


## Overview of interface
Sxmo is a bonified X environment running (patched) dwm so most of you're linux
knowledge should transfer. The core of the interface is based on the [multikey]()
patch for dwm which allows keybindings to be used for multiple purposes depending
on number of keypresses.

The default bindings are as follows:
- Volume Raise:
  - 1 tap: Launch [application-specific context dmenu]()
  - 2 taps: Launch [sxmo context dmenu]()
  - 3 taps (or hold): Move client to next tag
- Volume Lower:
  - 1 tap: Toggle dwm layout algorithm (between monocole/tile/bstack)
  - 2 taps: Shift current client in stack
  - 3 taps (or hold): Kill client
- Powerkey:
  - 1 tap: Toggle sxkbd onscreen keyboard
  - 2 taps: Launch st
  - 3 taps (or hold): Launch surf

In addition to the following programs, the [sxmo-utils]() repository contains the scripts
that piece the sxmo environment toegheter.
